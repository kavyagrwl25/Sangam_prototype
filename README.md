ü§ù SANGAM Alumni Networking Platform Prototype
SANGAM (Alumni-Student Engagement Platform) is a pro
totype built using React and styled with Bootstrap 5. It simulates a professional networking site that connects students with alumni mentors based on skill compatibility.

‚ú® Features
Role-Based Authentication: Users can log in as Student, Alumni, or Admin.

Skill Matching: The Dashboard uses a memoized function to match the user's profile skills (e.g., React, Node.js) against mock alumni data, displaying a compatibility score.

Dynamic Profile: Students can edit their skills and profile information, instantly updating mentorship matches.

Routing: Simple routing implemented to showcase different modules: Dashboard, Chat, and Events.

Bootstrap Styling: Fully styled using Bootstrap 5 classes for responsive design.
